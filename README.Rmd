## Overview

In this four-hour workshop, I will take you on a tour of how to get from data to manuscript using R Markdown. Starting with a mock medical dataset, we'll use R Markdown to combine prose, R code, and figures and tables created with R code into a nicely formatted and reproducible final manuscript. 

## Learning objectives

[ADD LEARNING OBJECTIVES]

## Is this course for me?

This introductory workshop is targeted at people who work in the medical field who either don't know or currently use R Markdown, or perhaps know the basics but aren't sure how R Markdown can fit into their research workflow. No prior experience with R Markdown is required.

- Have you written or collaborated on a medical manuscript to submit for publication to a peer-reviewed journal? Are you familiar with common components of a medical manuscript like a "Table One", other summary tables, plots, text and citations?

- Have you downloaded and used R a bit? Can you install and load packages?
  - *Even better,* have you used `tidyverse` packages like `ggplot2` and `dplyr`? 

- Have you used R with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)? Are you familiar with the various "panes" and "tabs"? For instance, can you quickly find all objects in your current global environment, and can you send R code from a source file (.R, .Rmd) to the console? 
  - *Even better,* have you tried to knit `r emo::ji("yarn")` an R Markdown document to some kind of output format like HTML, PDF, or Word?

## Pre-work

Please bring a laptop that has the following installed:

+ A recent version of R (>=3.6.0), which is available for free at https://cloud.r-project.org/
+ A recent version of RStudio Desktop (>=1.2), available for free ([RStudio Desktop Open Source License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download))
+ The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:

  ```{r eval = FALSE}
  install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "janitor", "here", 
                     "skimr", "flextable", "kable", "kableExtra"))
  ```

And don't forget your power cord!

Also, please sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/. On the day of the workshop, I'll provide you with an RStudio Cloud project that contains all of the course materials. We will use the software listed above only as an important backup should there be problems with the on-site internet connection.

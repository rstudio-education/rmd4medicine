## Overview

In this four-hour workshop, I will take you on a tour of how to get from
data to manuscript using R Markdown. Starting with a mock medical
dataset, we’ll use R Markdown to combine prose, R code, and figures and
tables created with R code into a nicely formatted and reproducible
final manuscript.

## Learning objectives

\[ADD LEARNING OBJECTIVES\]

## Is this course for me?

This introductory workshop is targeted at people who work in the medical
field who either don’t know or currently use R Markdown, or perhaps know
the basics but aren’t sure how R Markdown can fit into their research
workflow. No prior experience with R Markdown is required.

  - Have you written or collaborated on a medical manuscript to submit
    for publication to a peer-reviewed journal? Are you familiar with
    common components of a medical manuscript like a “Table One”, other
    summary tables, plots, text and citations?

  - Have you downloaded and used R a bit? Can you install and load
    packages?
    
      - *Even better,* have you used `tidyverse` packages like `ggplot2`
        and `dplyr`?

  - Have you used R with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment
    (IDE)? Are you familiar with the various “panes” and “tabs”? For
    instance, can you quickly find all objects in your current global
    environment, and can you send R code from a source file (.R, .Rmd)
    to the console?
    
      - *Even better,* have you tried to knit 🧶 an R Markdown document
        to some kind of output format like HTML, PDF, or Word?
